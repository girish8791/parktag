// Head to head against "a typical QR tag", not against a named competitor.
//
// Every claim in the ParkTag column is checkable in this repo or on the
// listing: a year of Premium ships with each tag, messaging keeps working after
// it lapses (call-access.js blocks the masked CALL, not the message), no app is
// needed to scan, and CALL / WHATSAPP are printed on the artwork.
//
// Nothing in the other column names anyone or quotes a figure. Comparative
// claims about a named competitor have to be substantiable, and "45 days" or
// "needs an app" cannot be checked from here. Swap in the name and the specific
// numbers once there is a screenshot of their listing to stand behind.
