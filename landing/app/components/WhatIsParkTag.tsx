// Replaces the eight-icon "Some Special Features" strip.
//
// That strip listed properties — Waterproof Tag, Any Vehicle Type, Instant Scan
// Alert — to somebody who did not yet know what the object was. Eight abstract
// nouns in two rows, no heading, no sentence, and the reader still could not
// have told you what ParkTag is afterwards.
//
// These are the four moments the product exists for instead. A scenario tells
// you what it is and when you would want one in the same breath, which a
// property cannot: "Waterproof Tag" answers a question nobody has asked yet.
//
// All four come from the product's own reasons list, the same set the scanner
// page offers a stranger when they scan a tag.
