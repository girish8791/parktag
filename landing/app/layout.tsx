  // www.parktag.me and parktag.me both answer 200 with identical content and

  //
  // A www -> apex redirect was the obvious alternative and was rejected after
  // testing: Next applies redirects() BEFORE headers(), so a 308 goes out with
  // no headers on it at all — no HSTS included. www would then never be pinned
  // to HTTPS in any browser, leaving http://www.parktag.me strippable forever.
  // Serving www a real page with the full header set, and naming the apex as
  // canonical, keeps the TLS posture and fixes the duplicate-content half.
  // Folding www into the apex properly belongs at DNS/Railway, where the
  // redirect can carry HSTS of its own.
